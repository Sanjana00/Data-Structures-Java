# Data-Structures-Java
Data structures implemented in Java programming language.

# Usage
Stack, Queue and BinSearch classes are dependent on the Node class and BST is dependent on the BSTNode class.

To implement stack, run the main() of Stack

To implement queue, run the main() of Queue

To implement a binary search tree, run the main() of BST

To implement binary search on a linked list sorted in ascending order, run the main() of BinSearch
